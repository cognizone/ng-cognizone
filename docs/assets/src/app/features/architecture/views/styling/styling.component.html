      Substance over form right ? But for a UI/UX to be great, you need some
      <span appImgTooltip="https://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/t1lmQR7sXeZJC/giphy.gif">pazazz</span>, and that comes from styling with
      css (well, <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">scss</a> in our case). If you are not familiar with scss,
      <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax">their documentation</a> is not very long and a great place to start.

    Structuring
  </h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      As with the "angular part" of the app, we also want to have structure for our global styling. In a perfect world, your structure would
      look like this so that it (kinda) follows
      <a
        href="https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern"
        appImgTooltip="https://miro.medium.com/max/628/1*0MP59mq0K_Hi2ECSb_Zwhg.png"
        [imgStyle]="{ 'max-height': '800px', 'max-width': '400px' }"
      >
        the 7-1 pattern </a
      >, but with a few quirks to make it Angular-y :
    </p>
    <div fxLayout fxLayoutAlign="start">
      <img src="assets/architecture/styles-structure.png" />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <app-inline-code>abstracts</app-inline-code>: here are all the scss files that do not produce any css on their own. That means
          that you could <app-inline-code>@import '...';</app-inline-code> all the partials from this folder in another file and it will not
          generate any css rules unless you declaratively use the mixins, placeholders, etc. that are inside those files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <app-inline-code>base</app-inline-code>:
          <app-blockquote from="https://sass-guidelin.es/#base-folder">
            The base/ folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. In there, you might find the reset file, some
            typographic rules, and probably a stylesheet defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements (that I like to call
            _base.scss).
          </app-blockquote>
          <span> Note that you might have close to a 0% chance of having to create your own reset file (see below)</span>
        </li>
        <li><app-inline-code>layout</app-inline-code>: contains layout related styling, so mostly grid related rules.</li>
        <li>
          <app-inline-code>themes</app-inline-code>: You should just know that all sub-folders are one theme and need to follow the same
          structure as the "root" styles folder. See below if you have needs for theming (did I just hear someone yell "Swiss" in the back
          ?)
        </li>
        <li>
          <app-inline-code>vendors</app-inline-code>: here you put scss code that imports styles from node_modules, one file per npm package
          ideally. you can have a look at
          <a
            href="https://bitbucket.org/cognizone/ng-cognizone/src/master/projects/docs-app/src/styles/vendors/_material.scss"
            appComponentTooltip="code"
            [inputs]="{ url: 'assets/src/styles/vendors/_material.scss' }"
            >_material.scss</a
          >
          for example.
        </li>
        <li>
          <app-inline-code>main.scss</app-inline-code>: this is where the
          <span appImgTooltip="https://media.giphy.com/media/VHngktboAlxHW/giphy-downsized-large.gif">magic</span> happens, its the file
          that will be imported in your <app-inline-code>angular.json</app-inline-code> file an so that will be used to generate the global
          styling of your app.
          <app-code-block url="assets/src/styles/main.scss"></app-code-block>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>Naming</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Everything should be in <app-inline-code>kebab-case</app-inline-code>, except for constants that should be in
      <app-inline-code>SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE</app-inline-code>.
    </li>
    <!-- TODO Not sure about this... -->
    <!-- <li>
    Classes created for your app should be prefixed by <app-inline-code>app-</app-inline-code> to prevent colliding issues with some
    framework and/or library you might be using. For example, it is common to have some sort of container in your component, so you might
    want to create your own <app-inline-code>.container</app-inline-code> css class, but this might clash with the
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/">Bootstrap one</a>.
  </!-->
    <li>
      If you need modifier classes like the <app-inline-code>d-flex</app-inline-code> class from Bootstrap, you should prefix them with
      <app-inline-code>is-</app-inline-code>, so you might have a class called <app-inline-code>is-flex</app-inline-code> for example.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>Components</h2>
  <p>
    One of the purpose of the aforementioned structure is to enable you to easily and cleanly style your components. So, you might want to
    use your variables and your mixins in your component stylesheet right ? You first reflex might be to do something like this:
  </p>

  <app-code-block
    [code]="badImportsScss"
    language="scss"
    appImgTooltip="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOwG5IshvzNMdzR72/giphy.gif"
  ></app-code-block>

  <p>
    This is not really great is it? We can do better ! First, you will have to adapt your
    <app-inline-code>angular.json</app-inline-code> file. In particular, it's the
    <a href="https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config#style-preprocessor-options">stylePreprocessorOptions</a> we want to add.
  </p>

  <app-code-block [code]="angularJsonImports" language="json"></app-code-block>

  <p>With this, your component's stylesheet could be as elegant as</p>

  <app-code-block url="assets/src/app/shared/components/code-block/code-block.component.scss"></app-code-block>

  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>Theming (compile time)</h2>
  <p>
    If you followed the previous sections, you just need a few extra steps for each theme you will have. First you'll have to add a folder
    for your new theme like shown in the structure section above for a sweet sweet dark theme. Ideally, you will not need much more then the
    <app-inline-code>mains.scss</app-inline-code> and <app-inline-code>_variables.scss</app-inline-code>. You can see below a naive
    implementation of a dark theme.
  </p>
  <div fxLayout="row wrap" fxLayoutAlign="space-around">
    <app-code-block
      url="assets/src/styles/themes/dark/abstracts/_variables.scss"
      prefix="// src/styles/themes/dark/abstracts/_variables.scss"
    ></app-code-block>
    <app-code-block url="assets/src/styles/themes/dark/main.scss" prefix="// src/styles/themes/dark/main.scss"></app-code-block>
  </div>
  <p>
    This might feel a bit convoluted but this structure gives you theming both for global styling and component styling. The last thing you
    have to adapt is the infamous <app-inline-code>angular.json</app-inline-code> and add two new configurations for you theme next to the
    production configuration.
  </p>
  <app-code-block [code]="angularJsonDarkTheme1"></app-code-block>
  <p>
    You will notice that the "production-dark" is a merge between the "production" and the "dark" configurations. With all that, your
    scripts for developing and building the app could be:
  </p>
  <app-code-block [code]="darkThemeScripts" language="bash"></app-code-block>

  <h3 class="mat-h3">Note on angular 9+</h3>
  <p>
    Coming in angular 9, we will be able to use multiple configurations in one command line, so the "production-dark" could be removed and
    the scripts would look like
  </p>
  <app-code-block [code]="darkThemeScripts9" language="bash"></app-code-block>

  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>Css reset</h2>
  <p>
    The thing is, all browsers are not born equal and in regard to this topic, default css rules for buttons, list and others might not be
    consistent depending on which browser you are using (and in particular, which
    <span appImgTooltip="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RKy5Z397Ca0/Tybm-UdyjBI/AAAAAAAABNI/QppDWOmJiRw/s1600/evilinternetexplorer.jpg"
      >browser your user is using</span
    >). In this regard, it is always better to do a good cleanup at the start to standardize default styling.
  </p>

  <p>There are a few options available depending on the strength of the visual identity your application need to have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Reset CSS</a>: this ancestral css reset is quite basic and kinda remove
      everything, so it's a good base if you want to define everything on your own. It is also available as an
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/reset.css">unofficial npm package</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a> is a more lenient reset that keeps a few basics (like lists
      keeping their bullets). It's a good start to have consistency but also usability for the base html elements.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/reboot/">Reboot</a> is the css reset of bootstrap and it you should be your choice,
      well, if you use bootstrap in your app. It might be a good choice even if it's the only part of bootstrap you will use (and it is
      based on Normalize.css!). Beware that it comes with a great design idea which is
      <app-inline-code>*{{ '{' }}box-sizing: border-box;}</app-inline-code> which might be problematic for some situations, like when using
      <app-inline-code>mat-form-field</app-inline-code> from angular material.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>Css frameworks/libraries</h2>
  <p>
    So, chances are, you don't want to start from scratch for your styles right? There are a
    <span appImgTooltip="https://media.giphy.com/media/cvyjkCiOw1QRy/giphy.gif">lots of solutions available to us today</span>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mat-h3" appAnchor>Angular material</h3>
  <p>
    Ok ok, this is more of an angular/javascript library than a css one, but hear me out. So, material is a set of extensive
    <a href="https://material.io/design/">styling guidelines</a> that aims to provide a highly consistent and qualitative UX. Because of
    this, material has a really strong visual identity so it might be hard to tweak it to your needs, but if your needs are close enough to
    the material design specs, this should be your go-to solution. In deed, the angular material library comes with a lot of qualitative
    components and services that are easy(-ish) to use and requires from you very few (styling) customization.
  </p>
  <p>
    And what about css? The thing is, angular material is more about providing styled components then a css framework. You do have a few
    classes to be used anywhere in your app like the ones for <a href="https://material.angular.io/guide/elevation">elevation</a> or for
    <a href="https://material.angular.io/guide/typography">typography</a>, but that is it. So, if you need need more, please look at the
    rest of this list.
  </p>

  <h3 class="mat-h3" appAnchor>Bootstrap</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap</a> is the current ruler of the css frameworks
    empire and it has been wearing the crown for several years now. It really is a good place to start, and even without the "component"
    part of the framework, all the different helpers classes are quite useful, like their
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/">grid system</a> or the different
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/borders/">utility classes</a>. If you already are using a more component oriented
    framework like angular material, it might be a good idea that, instead of directly importing
    <app-inline-code>bootstrap.scss</app-inline-code>, you put a dedicated file in your vendors folder and import only the needed scss files
    from bootstrap. Based on the source-code of <app-inline-code>bootstrap.scss</app-inline-code>, you could have something like this:
  </p>
  <app-code-block [code]="bootstrapScss" language="scss"></app-code-block>
  <p>
    But we are in angular, so what do we want? Styled components! And when do we want them? Right now! So the previous example is not good
    enough, we need to split things up a bit:
  </p>
  <div class="d-flex align-items-start" style="justify-content: space-around;">
    <img src="assets/architecture/styles-bootstrap.png" />
    <div class="d-flex flex-wrap align-items-start" style="justify-content: space-around;">
      <app-code-block
        prefix="// styles/vendors/bootstrap/_abstract.scss"
        url="assets/src/styles/vendors/bootstrap/_abstract.scss"
      ></app-code-block>
      <app-code-block prefix="// styles/vendors/bootstrap/_base.scss" url="assets/src/styles/vendors/bootstrap/_base.scss"></app-code-block>
      <app-code-block
        prefix="// styles/vendors/bootstrap/_override.scss"
        url="assets/src/styles/vendors/bootstrap/_override.scss"
      ></app-code-block>
      <app-code-block prefix="// styles/vendors/_bootstrap.scss" url="assets/src/styles/vendors/_bootstrap.scss"></app-code-block>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With this in place, you can use bootstrap at both:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      the global level: you just need to add <app-inline-code>@import 'vendors/bootstrap.scss';</app-inline-code> to your
      <app-inline-code>main.scss</app-inline-code> file
    </li>
    <li>
      the component level: depending on what you need, you might just want to add
      <app-inline-code>@import 'vendors/bootstrap/abstract';</app-inline-code> to your file to start using bootstrap stuff in your
      component, like here below.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <app-code-block url="assets/src/app/shared/components/code-block/code-block.component.scss"></app-code-block>

  <h3 class="mat-h3" appAnchor>Others</h3>
  <p>Here is a short list of qualitative libraries that you might want to at least read about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> is a pure scss library that comes only with abstract entities (mixin, etc.). So this is
      just like <app-inline-code>lodash</app-inline-code> but for scss. A good example of its usefulness is its
      <a href="https://www.bourbon.io/docs/latest/#ellipsis">ellipsis mixin</a> or the more trivial but expressive
      <a href="https://www.bourbon.io/docs/latest/#border-left-radius">border-left-radius mixin</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a> is, as its developers say, a utility based css library, and the thing is, it's how we
      mostly use Bootstrap anyway. So, to its core, this library is really "styled components" friendly. The downfall is that it is quite
      <a href="https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/using-tailwindcss-with-angular/">hard to use with "vanilla" angular</a> for the moment
      since it uses PostCSS, but with the cli's future developments, this might be easier to integrate at some point.
    </li>
    <li>
      Last but definitely not least, <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a> is really worth checking out. It's pure (s)css, so no javascript
      involved and its api is quite straightforward. This might be the most serious competitor of Bootstrap at the moment.
    </li>
  </ul>
