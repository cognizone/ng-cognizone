    <p>
      Creating a new angular application is as simple as
      <app-inline-code>ng new my-application-name --routing --style=scss</app-inline-code>. If you haven't already, it's advised to take a
      look at the <a href="https://angular.io/tutorial" target="_blank">tour of heroes tutorial on the angular website</a> which is a nice
      introduction to the angular environment. After creating the basic structure, there are a few things to do in order to make it
      architecturally great (again?).

  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>Adapting tsconfig</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      We want to add some entries in the root <app-inline-code>tsconfig.json</app-inline-code> file, particularly look at the paths and
      strict attributes here below. <app-inline-code>"strict": true</app-inline-code> enable all
      <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html" target="_blank">strict flags</a> for the typescript
      compiler. The <app-inline-code>paths</app-inline-code> entries' main purpose is to have cleaner imports like
      <app-inline-code>import {{ '{' }} MyService } from '@app/core'</app-inline-code> and
      <app-inline-code>import {{ '{' }} environment } from '@env/environment'</app-inline-code>
    </p>
    <app-code-block language="json" [code]="tsconfig1"></app-code-block>

  <h3 class="mat-h3" appAnchor>Setup</h3>
  <section>
    <p>You just need to run this command line and follow the questions and everything will be setup for you:</p>

    <app-code-block language="bash" [code]="lintingCommand"></app-code-block>

    <p>To summarize, here is what the cli has done for your project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are following Cognizone conventions by extending tslint and prettier configs coming from both packages</li>
      <li>With lint-staged set up, every time files are committed, they are passed trough prettier and tslint, which mean</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They are formatted by prettier, following rules coming from @cognizone/prettier, so no more white space, tabs, comma, ...
          discussions and issues with merge conflict
        </li>
        <li>
          *.ts files go trough tslint and are fixed by it, so, for example, imports are ordered, which again minimize conflicts. But tslint
          cannot fix everything by itself, so if one or more files fail linting, the commit is aborted.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you accepted to format your files, every compatible files have been formatted using prettier. Beware that since all those files
          will be in your next commit, they might throw errors if they are not tslint compliant. See below for a workaround if you don't
          have the time or the courage to fix them all.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

  <h3 class="mat-h3" appAnchor>Tslint workarounds</h3>
  <section>
    <p>
      Sometime, tslint is driving you crazy and so you might want to disable it in some places or be able to commit without it bugging you.
      If so, here are a few tip & tricks.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mat-h4">Tslint rules are not applicable for this line/file</h4>
    <p>You can disable tslint rules like in the code below:</p>
    <app-code-block url="assets/src/app/core/services/highlight.service.ts"></app-code-block>
    <ul>
      <li>
        On line 2, we see that <app-inline-code>no-import-side-effect</app-inline-code> and
        <app-inline-code>ordered-imports</app-inline-code> are disabled for all the lines below line 2 in this file.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the line just above <app-inline-code>declare var Prism: any;</app-inline-code>, we see that, for this particular line, the
        <app-inline-code>no-any</app-inline-code> rule is disabled.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Before doing such adaptation, please take a moment to verify if you really need to disable the rules, but is is acceptable to have
      <app-inline-code>any</app-inline-code> types in a really generic par of the code for example (but you might want to use
      <a href="https://mariusschulz.com/blog/the-unknown-type-in-typescript"> <app-inline-code>unknown</app-inline-code> </a> instead?).
    </p>

    <h4 class="mat-h4">Tslint rules are applicable, but I don't have the time to adapt everything right now.</h4>
    <p>
      Tslint rules are checked upon commit, using the git hooks, but you can disable it if need be. If you use the GUI from Intellij to
      commit, you can disable the git hooks by disabling the checkbox as shown below:
    </p>
    <img src="assets/architecture/git-hooks-intellij.png" />
    <p>
      If you use git trough command line, when you commit, you can just add the <app-inline-code>--no-verify</app-inline-code> flag to your
      command, like this:
    </p>
    <app-code-block code="git commit --no-verify -m'fix: an issue''" language="bash"></app-code-block>
