  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>General information</h2>
  <section>
    <p>Here are a few global rules to follow when creating a component:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Methods that are not used in the template and that are not life-cycle methods should be private, so that it's easier to see
        <span appImgTooltip="https://wandervogeldiary.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/i-see-dead-people.jpg">actual dead code</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Injected services should be private, and by extension, not used directly in the template. So usage of services should be proxied by
        the component's attributes and/or methods.
      </li>
      <li>At its base, a component is a class, so it shouldn't be 5000+ lines longs. (300 is already too long in most cases)</li>
      <li>
        Same thing for the html template, is it too long? You might want to create "sub components" to split a bit your presentation logic
        (and maybe make them OnPush? üòÅ)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>Dumb/smart spectrum</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      Since you are developing a web application, the environment you are in is stateful, and the components you create are, in some way or
      another, conscious of that state. In that regard, the dumbest possible component is one for which its local state is only dependent on
      its inputs (and outputs of its children). On the other side of the spectrum, the "smartest" component can be totally aware of the
      global state and so it's internal state is mostly driven by calls to services.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, is there a best solution? The short answer is "no", the long answer is "no, but let me explain...". Intuitively, a dumb component
      is considered better since it could be associated to pure functions and those are great right ? It's more predictable, easier to
      maintain and easier to test. But we are in an application with a state, we cannot have only dumb components. And so your next question
      would be, how smart a smart component should be ? It's hard to pinpoint but here are a few rules of thumb:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Globally speaking, a smart component should, in its essence, be a bridge between dumb components and the service layer, but still
        has a low/medium complexity.
      </li>
      <li>
        In this regard, it should not know about url to contact and have complex query building logic, this should be given to the service
        layer. So, if you are going to search for cats trough an api, you should have a <app-inline-code>CatService</app-inline-code> that
        knows about the corresponding endpoint and how to interact with it.

        <app-code-block [code]="catExample"></app-code-block>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>Change detection</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      By default, angular use some eager change detection strategy, so the template of a component is evaluated multiple times whenever the
      user interacts with the page. Here below are twice the (almost) same component (<app-code-link
        path="app/features/architecture/components/cd-default/cd-default.component.ts"
        >ts</app-code-link
      >
      and
      <app-code-link path="app/features/architecture/components/cd-default/cd-default.component.html">html</app-code-link>), the only
      difference being that C1 has the default change detection and C2 has the OnPush change detection. There is also a third (C3) component
      that you can toggle which has an OnPush detection strategy and used rxjs' interval inside.
    </p>
    <mat-card>
      <mat-form-field>
        <mat-label>"number" input for C1 and C2</mat-label>
        <input matInput [formControl]="numberControl" type="number" />
      </mat-form-field>
      <div fxLayout>
        <app-cd-default [number]="numberControl.value"></app-cd-default>
        <app-cd-on-push [number]="numberControl.value"></app-cd-on-push>
        <div>
          <button mat-raised-button (click)="showIntervalComponent = !showIntervalComponent">Toggle Component with interval inside</button>
          @if (showIntervalComponent) {
          <app-on-push-async-pipe></app-on-push-async-pipe>
          }
        </div>
      </div>
    </mat-card>
    <p>After playing a bit with the different interactive elements above, you might have seen interesting stuff:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        C1 has its rendering count increasing whenever there is some interaction with the page: a button being click, a tooltip being
        rendered, the input value being changed, etc.
      </li>
      <li>C2's rendering count only increases when you click on its button or when you change the input value.</li>
      <li>
        When C3 is rendered, we see that C1 is evaluated every time the interval is fired inside C3. This is because of how angular
        interacts with <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/zone-js-for-angular-devs-573d89bbb890">Zone.js</a>. You can see an
        example of how to opt out of Zone.js for performance reason
        <app-code-link path="app/shared/components/anchor-nav/anchor-nav.component.ts" [showPreview]="false">here</app-code-link>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All in all, we see that the <app-inline-code>getDouble</app-inline-code> method is called a lot of times. This number of evaluations
      is not a problem per se and most of the time it is not an issue because angular kinda knows when to stop evaluating templates.
      Regardless, you need to keep in mind that, in regular components, you need to keep the complexity of your methods and getters used in
      your template as low as possible.

  <h3 class="mat-h3">OnPush</h3>
  <section>
    <p>
      So OnPush is really great but it comes with a few shortcomings. Components that follow this strategy have their templates only
      evaluated when their inputs change or when the user interacts within the scope of these components, which means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This change detection on the inputs is not smart in anyway, so if one of the inputs is an object, changing one of its property will
        not trigger change detection. That is one of the reasons why immutability is a big part of angular development and reactive
        programming in general.
      </li>
      <li>You have to do some nitpicking if you deal with async and/or observables.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <div class="mat-h3">OnPush & async</div>
  <section>
    <p>
      You have 2 main ways of handling async scenarios, either using
      <a href="https://angular.io/api/core/ChangeDetectorRef">ChangeDetectionRef</a> or the
      <a href="https://angular.io/api/common/AsyncPipe">AsyncPipe</a> (or a combination of both). The first solution might give you a code
      that looks like this:
    </p>

    <div fxLayout="row wrap" fxLayoutAlign="space-around">
      <app-code-block url="assets/src/app/features/architecture/components/on-push-cd-ref/on-push-cd-ref.component.ts"></app-code-block>
      <app-code-block url="assets/src/app/features/architecture/components/on-push-cd-ref/on-push-cd-ref.component.html"></app-code-block>
    </div>

    <p>
      Ok, this is a working solution, optimized and the html is clean buuuuuuut... the typescript part is a bit complex and that is with
      only one subscription. Fortunately, we have the <app-inline-code>AsyncPipe</app-inline-code> to the rescue!
    </p>

    <div fxLayout="row wrap" fxLayoutAlign="space-around">
      <app-code-block
        url="assets/src/app/features/architecture/components/on-push-async-pipe/on-push-async-pipe.component.ts"
      ></app-code-block>
      <app-code-block
        url="assets/src/app/features/architecture/components/on-push-async-pipe/on-push-async-pipe.component.html"
      ></app-code-block>
    </div>

    <p>
      Hey, that is one fancy component, the html is clean and the typescript is elegantly simple (and it is the code of the C3 component
      used above). There is even no need to handle the subscription's life-cycle, because the
      <app-inline-code>AsyncPipe</app-inline-code> is that great and it should be your go-to solution for this kind of problem, even with
      the default detection strategy!
    </p>

    <div class="mat-h3" appImgTooltip="https://www.flickfilosopher.com/wptest/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/tennanthamletyorick.gif">
      OnPush or not OnPush ?
    </div>
    <p>
      You might have seen this coming, but there is no clear answer for this, it depends on the situation (doesn't it always ?). But hey, I
      like lists so here are some thoughts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If your component is really dumb, and that its inputs follows the immutability principle, you should make it OnPush, it should be
        effortless f it is as dumb as yu think.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your component is further on the spectrum and that you don't see any performance issue, there usually is no need for the OnPush
        strategy and the possible complexity that this might add to your code
      </li>
      <li>Most of the components in your <app-inline-code>SharedModule</app-inline-code> should be OnPush.</li>
    </ul>
