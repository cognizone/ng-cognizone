# Introduction 

Cognizone elastic explorer is a chrome extension that has been developed to ease the use of Elasticsearch for both developers and project managers.

Data can be viewed in a simple(JSON) yet detailed format that eases the review of a complex elastic document.

More information on how to use this application can be found on [how to use](./how-to-use.md) page.

This application is aimed to be a friendlier alternative to Elastichead, with features that are dedicated to the typical data models that we use at Cognizone.

It is easy to [install](./installation.md) and to setup the extension on chromium based browser.
